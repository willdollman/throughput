# Network benchmarking

Set up a target computer that's wired to the router. Run this on a second machine, and the benchmark will copy a file over the network, and time how long it takes.

You can perform multiple runs from different locations, and will be prompted for a short description of your location on each run. Location and throughput speeds will be recorded in a CVS file for further prodding.
